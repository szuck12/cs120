        <h3>Short Summary of A Trip I Took</h3>
        <p>
            Two summers ago, I went on a roadtrip with a friend from Denver 
            to San Francisco. First, we drove west across Colorado, climbing 
            up through the Rocky Mountains. Next, we crossed over into Utah 
            and visited many National Parks, including Arches National Park in 
            Moab and Bryce Canyon National Park.
        </p> 
        <p>
            Then, we crossed over into California through Death Valley, and our 
            trusty car overheated from the suffocating summer heat! 
            Fortunately, we were able to drive out of Death Valley at night, 
            and travel up the coastal highway Route 1 until we reached 
            San Francisco.

        <h3>My Favorite Restaurant</h3>
        <a href="https://www.oharas.us" target="_blank">O'Hara's, An Amazing Restaurant!</a>
        <p>
            O'Hara's is a fantastic restaurant located in Newton, 
            Massachusetts. There are many reasons why O'Hara's is my favorite
            restaurant, but first and most importantly, the food is amazing. 
            My family always goes for their pretzel bites as an appetizer, 
            which come salted and with a delicious beer-based cheese sauce. 
        </p>
        <p>
            For the main course, some of my favorites are Rafael's Burger, 
            their fried chicken sandwich, and the mac and cheese. The portions 
            range from generous to massive, with their shepard's pie being
            large enough for at least a day or two of leftovers. Also, the 
            prices are incredibly reasonable and O'Hara's boasts a lively 
            atmosphere. However, if you want to go on a weekend, make sure to 
            go early, or else you'll be in for a long wait!
        </p>
        <p> 
            All things considered, eating an early dinner at O'Hara's is 
            definitely worth it, considering the quality of food and service 
            that O'Hara's provides.

        <h3>My Favorite Food</h3>
        <img src="images/ChickenAndRice.jpg" align="left" 
             alt="Grilled chicken on top of white rice" height="150">
        <p> 
            My favorite food is grilled chicken with rice. To prepare this dish,
            I first cut the chicken into thin slices, and then cook the chicken
            until it is lightly charred on the outside. As the chicken is 
            cooking, I add different seasonings to the chicken to give it extra
            flavor, including onion powder, black pepper and smoked paprika.
        </p>   
        <p> 
            Once the grilled chicken has been fully cooked, I pair it with rice,
            which I prepare in advance or prepare at the same time as the
            grilled chicken. Lastly, I sometimes add either a garlic aoili or 
            a siracha aoili to give the chicken additional flavor.
